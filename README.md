## Features

- **Data Generation**: Randomly generate synthetic input data for testing.
- **Data Loading**: Load multi-scenario data from Excel files.
- **Optimization**: Use Pyomo to solve a complex assignment problem involving agents, equipment, and activities across multiple scenarios.
- **Output Results**: Retrieve and visualize results for decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyomo`, `xlsxwriter`

Install missing dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pyomo xlsxwriter
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/optimization-scheduling.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd optimization-scheduling
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Input Data
Run the following script to generate synthetic input data and save it to an Excel file:
```bash
python generate_data.py
```
This creates a file named `Generated_data.xlsx` with the required input data.

### Step 2: Load Input Data
The script includes functionality to load data from the generated Excel file into a structured dictionary.

### Step 3: Solve the Optimization Model
Run the main script to solve the optimization problem:
```bash
python solve_model.py
```
This will output the agent assignments, equipment allocations, and time allocations to the console.

## Input Data Description

The input data consists of the following:

| Parameter      | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Dh`           | Importance of each activity.                           |
| `Tmin`, `Tmax` | Minimum and maximum time required for activities.       |
| `Kh`           | Fixed daily cost for activities.                       |
| `Bhj`          | Quality scores for agents for each activity.           |
| `Rhe`          | Quality scores for equipment for each activity.        |
| `Wij`          | Collaboration factor between agents.                   |
| `G`            | Fixed equipment cost per activity and scenario.        |
| `Beta`         | Variable cost factor per activity, equipment, and scenario. |

## Optimization Problem

The optimization model seeks to:
1. Maximize **quality** scores for agents and equipment assignments.
2. Minimize **fixed and variable costs**.
3. Maximize **collaboration scores** between agents.

### Decision Variables:
- `X[h, j, s]`: Binary variable for assigning agent `j` to activity `h` in scenario `s`.
- `Y[h, e, s]`: Binary variable for assigning equipment `e` to activity `h` in scenario `s`.
- `T[h, s]`: Time allocated for activity `h` in scenario `s`.
- `Z[h, i, j, s]`: Collaboration binary variable for agents `i` and `j` in activity `h`, scenario `s`.
- `Aux[h, e, s]`: Auxiliary variable for cost calculation.

## Results

After solving the model, the following outputs are generated:
1. **Agent Assignments**: Which agent is assigned to each activity in each scenario.
2. **Equipment Assignments**: Which equipment is assigned to each activity in each scenario.
3. **Time Allocations**: Time allocated for each activity in each scenario.

Results are displayed in the console for quick review.
